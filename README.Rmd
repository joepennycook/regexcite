# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of regexcite is to help me learn how to set up packages, following the examples in _R Packages_ by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan.

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("joepennycook/regexcite")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(regexcite)

x <- ("up-down-left-right")
str_split_one(x, pattern = "-")
```
